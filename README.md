# Memorizinator
A little memory game to help you learn big ideas. (Works best on Chrome browswer. Feedback is welcome.)

## Simplest Game Plan
1) Navigate to page. Words from chosen text will pop in as bubbles.  Timer starts (1.5 seconds / word in text).
2) Double click the bubbles in the proper order.
3) Game provides feedback (lower-left) about Win, Loss, Error.
4) Need a hint? 
   * ShowIt. Show the full text message (toggles).
   * SayIt. Audio of the text. [Only on Chrome]
   * BoldIt. The next correct word will be bolded (toggles). [Does not repaint existing bubbles; so it's active on the next repaint.]
5) Choose a new text in the upper right or Restart game in lower right.

## TODO
* Provide player more feedback about wrong choices.
* Ability to unravel answer?
* Have colors mean something? (paragraphs?)
* Improve BoldIt (so it works "now")
* Add an underscore based hint system ("I h--- f----- t-- g--- f----.")
