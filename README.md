# MemoryGame
[Just a simple beginning to this game....] A little game that will, eventually, help you memorize important things.

## Simplest Game Plan
Player begins game by opening web page. All words from selected text pop onto screen as small bubbles. Player then clicks bubble in correct order. Bubbles connect as player clicks them and float to upper-left.

## TODO
* Move template to App directory.


## Open
* Do I fix the location of selected circles? Or change size?


## Later 
### Game Mechanics
* Countdown timer, with points assigned based on how much time is left on the clock.  
* Point tracker
* Ability to choose which text.
* Color-coding based on paragraph or verse (make this optional)
* Restart button 


### Visual
* Use seperate gravity wells to keep "used" and "unused" words seperate.
* Provide feedback about correct, incorrect choices?
* Have all dots change color when section is completed?
*
